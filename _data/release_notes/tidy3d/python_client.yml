    description: 'We would like to highlight some simulation pricing changes starting
      from this release:'
    list:
    - text: We have worked on reducing our overhead and are happy to announce that
        we are decreasing the minimum charge per task from 0.2 to 0.1 flex units.
    - text: We have reduced the typical cost premium for dispersive materials in simulations,
        especially when only part of the simulation is dispersive.
    - text: We have added a cost for monitors, but this will be negligible in typical
        simulations, and will only be non-negligible for very large monitors. For
        example, for a very large frequency-domain monitor at many frequencies, such
        that the number of pixels in the monitor span times the number of frequencies
        is similar to the total number of pixels in the simulation, the charge for
        the monitor will still be only a fraction of the current charge for the simulation
        run.
