This paper presents results of the numerical study of the Bell XV-15 rotor with the flow solver Flow360 using a coupled Navier-Stokes/Blade Element Theory model. Results are presented for both steady-state and transient simulations. The resulting thrust, torque, and blade loadings show good agreement with high-fidelity DDES results computed with Flow360 and experiments.
