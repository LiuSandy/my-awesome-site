This paper presents numerical investigation on performance and flow field of the full-scale
XV-15 tiltrotor in both helicopter mode (hovering flight and forward flight) and aeroplane
propeller mode using Detached Eddy Simulation, in which the movement of the rotor is achieved
using a Sliding Mesh Interface. Comparison of our CFD results against experiment data and
other CFD results is performed and presented.
